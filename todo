correctness:
P2 - test convolution
P2 - test complicate equations (generate random valid equations)
P3 - test travelling, and pruning algorithms
P3 - verify rocnnet correctness using automated test
P3 - implement better fallback strategy when test server is unavailable

structure:
P2 - generalize prune for any ade extension and move to its own "optimization module"
P4 - after llo api experimentation, move rocnnet to its own repo

transparency:
P4 - investigate llo api: experiment with top-level code

performance:
P4 - implement optimization options to decrease equation graph size
P4 - implement optimization options to increase data accuracy

features:
P2 - implement llo-like api with eigen
