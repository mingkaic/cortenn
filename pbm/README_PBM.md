# PBM (Protobuf Marshaller)

Serialize ADE and LLO-extended graphs created by top-level code in protobuf format.

Protobuf is platform independent format for structured data.

## Why Protobuf

Because the library can be used across all the languages I'm familiar with. It's also more transparent and less bug-ridden than most free JSON parsing libraries.
