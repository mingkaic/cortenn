correctness:
P1 - (before merge to experimental branch) install tensorflow in test docker image
P2 - test travelling, and pruning algorithms
P4 - test complicate equations (generate random valid equations)

structure:
P2 - fix bwd sum reduction vs direct mapping problem (bwd/src/grader.cpp line:108)
P2 - after (bwd fix) sync correct version of local bwd with tenncor's bwd

performance:
P3 - benchmark llo performance
P3 - implement eigen version of llo
P4 - implement optimization options to decrease equation graph size in opt
P4 - implement optimization options to increase data accuracy
